## How to use
First, install [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) and [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) globally.

```bash
$ npm i -g webpack@1.0.5 webpack-dev-server@1.0.2
```

Then, clone the repo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kkcode24/webpack-demo.git
```

Install the dependencies.

```bash
$ cd webpack-demo
$ npm install
```

Now, play with the source files under the repo's demo* directories.

```bash
$ cd demo01
$ npm run dev
```

If the above command doesn't open your browser automaticly, you have to visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 by yourself.
